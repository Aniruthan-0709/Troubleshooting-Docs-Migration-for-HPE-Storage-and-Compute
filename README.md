# Troubleshooting Docs Migration for HPE Storage and Compute

## Overview
This repository hosts the project for migrating troubleshooting documents from the Decision Tree portal to the Knowledge Management (KM) Tool, with a focus on HPE storage and compute. It involves proofreading for technical accuracy, making necessary revisions, and then migrating the articles to SFDC Lightning. The project ensures that each article is vetted and approved by KT approvers to maintain high standards of reliability and precision.

### Objectives
- **Quality Assurance:** Thorough review for technical accuracy of HPE storage and compute articles.
- **Document Migration:** Efficient transfer of articles from Decision Tree portal to KM Tool.
- **Integration with SFDC Lightning:** Ensuring smooth integration and accessibility of articles in SFDC Lightning.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Access to the Decision Tree portal and KM Tool.
- Understanding of HPE storage and compute solutions.
- Knowledge of SFDC Lightning environment.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Set up access to both the Decision Tree portal and the KM Tool.
3. Ensure SFDC Lightning is integrated for final publishing of articles.

## Workflow
1. **Review:** Assess each article in the Decision Tree portal for technical accuracy.
2. **Edit:** Make necessary changes to enhance clarity and correctness.
3. **Migrate:** Transfer the revised articles to the KM Tool.
4. **Publish:** Submit articles for approval. Once approved, they are published in SFDC Lightning.
